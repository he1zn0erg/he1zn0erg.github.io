                Lisk is an open source blockchain platform powered by LSK tokens that will allow developers to write decentralized applications in the JavaScript programming language. Lisk will give developers the ability to build applications on their own sidechain linked to the Lisk network, with their own custom token.

                With the goal of making blockchain development more accessible Lisk was forked from Crypti by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows in May of 2016. Shortly after being listed Lisk became the second most popular cryptocurrency traded against Bitcoin.
